            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I love baking cakes and experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen. When I’m not baking, I enjoy watching web series and diving into different genres of music. Sleeping is my way of recharging, and I always look forward to a good meal, especially biryani. Balancing my academic life with these hobbies keeps me motivated and happy!</p>
